# Biomimetic Alignment Fix: Reframing from "Functional Isomorphism"

## Problem
The paper claimed "functional isomorphism" between biological mechanisms and computational interventions, implying we were simulating a brain or neurotransmitters. This is scientifically inaccurate:

**Issues:**
1. **"Functional Isomorphism"** implies identical mechanisms (we're not simulating serotonin)
2. **"Simulating" neurotransmitters** - we're doing linear algebra, not biology
3. **"Simulating a brain"** - we're borrowing control theory, not simulating biological mechanisms
4. **Overclaiming**: The math is just linear algebra, not biological simulation

## Solution: Reframe as "Biomimetic Alignment" or "Neuromorphic Control Primitives"

### Key Changes

**1. Terminology Replacement:**
- ❌ "Functional Isomorphism" → ✅ "Biomimetic Alignment"
- ❌ "Computational Isomorphism" → ✅ "Biomimetic Alignment"
- ❌ "Simulating serotonin/norepinephrine" → ✅ "Borrowing control theory from biological gain control"
- ❌ "Simulating a brain" → ✅ "Borrowing control primitives from biology to stabilize AI"

**2. Core Reframing:**
- **Old**: "We demonstrate functional isomorphism between biological gain control and computational inference steering"
- **New**: "We demonstrate biomimetic alignment—borrowing control theory from biological gain control mechanisms to stabilize algorithmic steering"

**3. Explicit Clarification:**
Added to Introduction:
> "We are not simulating a brain; we are borrowing control theory from biology to stabilize AI."

**4. Mechanism vs. Metaphor Section:**
- **Old**: "Biological 5-HT2A agonism ≈ Computational Residual Stream Steering"
- **New**: "Biological 5-HT2A control dynamics → Computational Residual Stream Steering (linear algebra, not serotonin)"
- Added: "We are borrowing control primitives, not simulating neurotransmitters."

**5. Conclusion Reframing:**
- **Old**: "Serotonergic Isomorphism: The 'Entropic Brain' hypothesis translates directly..."
- **New**: "Entropic Control Primitive: The 'Entropic Brain' control theory translates to transformer architectures. Injecting noise and orthogonal steering vectors (linear algebra operations) reliably induces a high-entropy, hyper-associative state...—not by simulating serotonin, but by borrowing the control principle."

### Files Modified

- `outputs/full_paper.tex`:
  - Abstract: Replaced "functional isomorphism" with "biomimetic alignment"
  - Introduction: Added explicit clarification that we're not simulating a brain
  - Introduction: Changed "functional blueprint" to "neuromorphic control primitives"
  - Introduction: Replaced "direct computational isomorphism" with "biomimetic alignment primitives"
  - Discussion: Reframed "Mechanism vs. Metaphor" section to clarify we're borrowing control theory
  - Ethics: Replaced "computational isomorphism" with "biomimetic alignment"
  - Conclusion: Replaced "functional isomorphism" with "biomimetic alignment"
  - Throughout: Replaced "simulating" with "borrowing control principle" or "implementing" where appropriate

### What We're Actually Doing

**We are:**
- Borrowing control theory from biological gain control mechanisms
- Implementing linear algebra operations (vector addition, attention scaling, cache decay)
- Using neuromorphic control primitives to stabilize AI
- Demonstrating biomimetic alignment (functional similarity in control dynamics)

**We are NOT:**
- Simulating a brain
- Simulating neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA)
- Creating identical mechanisms to biology
- Claiming functional isomorphism (identical mechanisms)

### Scientific Accuracy

The reframing makes it clear that:
1. **We're doing linear algebra**, not biology
2. **We're borrowing control primitives**, not simulating mechanisms
3. **We're demonstrating biomimetic alignment** (functional similarity in control dynamics), not isomorphism (identical mechanisms)
4. **The math is just math** - vector addition, attention scaling, cache management

This is scientifically defensible and accurate.
